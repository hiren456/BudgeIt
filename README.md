If you&#39;ve ever wondered where all your money goes, and want a simple way to track income and expenses, BudgeIt is your solution. BudgeIt is a budgeting app for visual learners; by presenting your monthly cash flow in easy to read charts and graphs, BudgeIt makes it easy to know exactly where your money is going each month. Anyone who earns and spends money can use BudgeIt.

BudgeIt gives users total customization in their budget. Users can create budget categories, and set a customizable time limit before each category resets. For example, a user may choose to create a &quot;Food&quot; category, where they would like to spend $50 a week. Each time a user makes a purchase, they enter it into BudgeIt and select which category it belongs to. Conversely, users can create savings categories, and set target goals for each category. The goal of a budget category is to minimize money spent, whereas the goal of a savings category is to save at least a certain amount each month.  Each time the user gets paid, they enter it into BudgeIt and select which category it belongs to. This allows the user to ensure that their income matches, or exceeds, their target budgeting goals.

Users with predictable income sources or expenses can set up recurring income or payments. For example, with this feature, instead of the user entering the amount they paid for a phone bill each month, they can set up a recurring payment, once, and BudgeIt will automatically add it, every month. Optionally, BudgeIt will also remind the user to pay their bills.

Throughout the month, users will be able to see each of their categories slowly &quot;budge&quot; towards the limit with a playful, colourful, and visually pleasing user interface. All of the user&#39;s categories are presented on the main page, so it is easy to track one&#39;s budgets and savings. Savings categories are presented in a positive colour, like green, while budget categories are presented in a more urgent colour, like red. All the budget categories will be visually represented in various forms. This includes pie charts and bar graphs, for the user&#39;s preferred period of time (as entered when creating a category). This will give the user a better sense of how they are spending their money. In addition to that, users will be able to compare their spending habits with nationwide statistics to give them an understanding of where they are on a nationwide scale in a financial context.

The main goal of BudgeIt is to help people use their money better. If, by using BudgeIt, users have gained insights on where their money goes each month, then BudgeIt is doing its job. Users should be able to quickly see how much they are spending in each of their categories each month.

By using BudgeIt, users will gain valuable insights into their spending habits.
