  <h2 id="issues-with-git-flow">Issues with git-flow</h2>

<p>I travel all over the place teaching Git to people and nearly every 
class and workshop I’ve done recently has asked me what I think about <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git-flow</a>.
  I always answer that I think that it’s great - it has taken a system 
(Git) that has a million possible workflows and documented a well 
tested, flexible workflow that works for lots of developers in a fairly 
straightforward manner.  It has become something of a standard so that 
developers can move between projects or companies and be familiar with 
this standardized workflow.</p>

<p>However, it does have its issues. I have heard a number of opinions 
from people along the lines of not liking that new feature branches are 
started off of <code class="highlighter-rouge">develop</code> rather than <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>, or the way it handles hotfixes, but those are fairly minor.</p>

<p>One of the bigger issues for me is that it’s more complicated than I 
think most developers and development teams actually require. It’s 
complicated enough that a big <a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow">helper script</a>
 was developed to help enforce the flow.  Though this is cool, the issue
 is that it cannot be enforced in a Git GUI, only on the command line, 
so the only people who have to learn the complex workflow really well, 
because they have to do all the steps manually, are the same people who 
aren’t comfortable with the system enough to use it from the command 
line.  This can be a huge problem.</p>

<p>Both of these issues can be solved easily just by having a much more 
simplified process. At GitHub, we do not use git-flow.  We use, and 
always have used, a much simpler Git workflow.</p>

<p>Its simplicity gives it a number of advantages.  One is that it’s 
easy for people to understand, which means they can pick it up quickly 
and they rarely if ever mess it up or have to undo steps they did wrong.
 Another is that we don’t need a wrapper script to help enforce it or 
follow it, so using GUIs and such are not a problem.</p>

<h2 id="github-flow">GitHub Flow</h2>

<p>So, why don’t we use git-flow at GitHub?  Well, the main issue is 
that we deploy all the time.  The git-flow process is designed largely 
around the “release”.  We don’t really have “releases” because we deploy
 to production every day - often several times a day.  We can do so 
through our chat room robot, which is the same place our CI results are 
displayed. We try to make the process of testing and shipping as simple 
as possible so that every employee feels comfortable doing it.</p>

<p>There are a number of advantages to deploying so regularly. If you 
deploy every few hours, it’s almost impossible to introduce large 
numbers of big bugs.  Little issues can be introduced, but then they can
 be fixed and redeployed very quickly.  Normally you would have to do a 
‘hotfix’ or something outside of the normal process, but it’s simply 
part of our normal process - there is no difference in the GitHub flow 
between a hotfix and a very small feature.</p>

<p>Another advantage of deploying all the time is the ability to quickly
 address issues of all kinds.  We can respond to security issues that 
are brought to our attention or implement small but interesting feature 
requests incredibly quickly, yet we can use the exact same process to 
address those changes as we do to handle normal or even large feature 
development.  It’s all the same process and it’s all very simple.</p>

<h3 id="how-we-do-it">How We Do It</h3>

<p>So, what is GitHub Flow?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anything in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch is deployable</li>
  <li>To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> (ie: <code class="highlighter-rouge">new-oauth2-scopes</code>)</li>
  <li>Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server</li>
  <li>When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a <a href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/">pull request</a></li>
  <li>After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master</li>
  <li>Once it is merged and pushed to ‘master’, you can and <em>should</em> deploy immediately</li>
</ul>

<p>That is the entire flow.  It is very simple, very effective and works
 for fairly large teams - GitHub is 35 employees now, maybe 15-20 of 
whom work on the same project (github.com) at the same time.  I think 
that most development teams - groups that work on the same logical code 
at the same time which could produce conflicts - are around this size or
 smaller.  Especially those that are progressive enough to be doing 
rapid and consistent deployments.</p>

<p>So, let’s look at each of these steps in turn.</p>

<h4 id="1---anything-in-the-master-branch-is-deployable">#1 - anything in the master branch is deployable</h4>

<p>This is basically the only hard <em>rule</em> of the system. There is only one branch that has any specific and consistent meaning and we named it <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>.
  To us, this means that it has been deployed or at the worst will be 
deployed within hours.  It’s incredibly rare that this gets rewound (the
 branch is moved back to an older commit to revert work) - if there is 
an issue, commits will be reverted or new commits will be introduced 
that fixes the issue, but the branch itself is almost never rolled back.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch is stable 
and it is always, always safe to deploy from it or create new branches 
off of it.  If you push something to master that is not tested or breaks
 the build, you break the social contract of the development team and 
you normally feel pretty bad about it.  Every branch we push has tests 
run on it and reported into the chat room, so if you haven’t run them 
locally, you can simply push to a topic branch (even a branch with a 
single commit) on the server and wait for <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> to tell you if it passes everything.</p>

<p>You could have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">deployed</code> 
branch that is updated only when you deploy, but we don’t do that.  We 
simply expose the currently deployed SHA through the webapp itself and <code class="highlighter-rouge">curl</code> it if we need a comparison made.</p>

<h4 id="2---create-descriptive-branches-off-of-master">#2 - create descriptive branches off of master</h4>

<p>When you want to start work on anything, you create a descriptively named branch off of the stable <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch.  Some examples in the GitHub codebase right now would be <code class="highlighter-rouge">user-content-cache-key</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">submodules-init-task</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">redis2-transition</code>.
  This has several advantages - one is that when you fetch, you can see 
the topics that everyone else has been working on.  Another is that if 
you abandon a branch for a while and go back to it later, it’s fairly 
easy to remember what it was.</p>

<p>This is nice because when we go to the GitHub branch list page we can
 easily see what branches have been worked on recently and roughly how 
much work they have on them.</p>

<p><img src="GitHub%20Flow%20%E2%80%93%20Scott%20Chacon_files/7988902c-d0a8-11e4-94c9-dc132461ffe4.png" alt="github branch list"></p>

<p>It’s almost like a list of upcoming features with current rough 
status. This page is awesome if you’re not using it - it only shows you 
branches that have unique work on them relative to your currently 
selected branch and it sorts them so that the ones most recently worked 
on are at the top. If I get really curious, I can click on the ‘Compare’
 button to see what the actual unified diff and commit list is that is 
unique to that branch.</p>

<p>So, as of this writing, we have 44 branches in our repository with 
unmerged work in them, but I can also see that only about 9 or 10 of 
them have been pushed to in the last week.</p>

<h4 id="3---push-to-named-branches-constantly">#3 - push to named branches constantly</h4>

<p>Another big difference from git-flow is that we push to named 
branches on the server constantly.  Since the only thing we really have 
to worry about is <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> from a deployment standpoint, pushing to the server doesn’t mess anyone up or confuse things - everything that is not <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> is simply something being worked on.</p>

<p>It also make sure that our work is always backed up in case of laptop
 loss or hard drive failure. More importantly, it puts everyone in 
constant communication.  A simple ‘git fetch’ will basically give you a 
TODO list of what every is currently working on.</p>

<p>It also lets everyone see, by looking at the GitHub Branch List page,
 what everyone else is working on so they can inspect them and see if 
they want to help with something.</p>

<h4 id="4---open-a-pull-request-at-any-time">#4 - open a pull request at any time</h4>

<p>GitHub has an amazing code review system called <a href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/">Pull Requests</a>
 that I fear not enough people know about.  Many people use it for open 
source work - fork a project, update the project, send a pull request to
 the maintainer.  However, it can also easily be used as an internal 
code review system, which is what we do.</p>

<p>Actually, we use it more as a branch conversation view more than a 
pull request. You can send pull requests from one branch to another in a
 single project (public or private) in GitHub, so you can use them to 
say “I need help or review on this” in addition to “Please merge this 
in”.</p>

<p><img src="GitHub%20Flow%20%E2%80%93%20Scott%20Chacon_files/61a2dcba-d0a8-11e4-9924-3576232053ee.png" alt="early pr message"></p>

<p>Here you can see Josh cc’ing Brian for review and Brian coming in 
with some advice on one of the lines of code.  Further down we can see 
Josh acknowledging Brian’s concerns and pushing more code to address 
them.</p>

<p><img src="GitHub%20Flow%20%E2%80%93%20Scott%20Chacon_files/5054b4ba-d0a8-11e4-8d38-548ecf157018.png" alt="more discussion"></p>

<p>Finally you can see that we’re still in the trial phase - this is not
 a deployment ready branch yet, we use the Pull Requests to review the 
code long before we actually want to merge it into <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> for deployment.</p>

<p>If you are stuck in the progress of your feature or branch and need 
help or advice, or if you are a developer and need a designer to review 
your work (or vice versa), or even if you have little or no code but 
some screenshot comps or general ideas, you open a pull request.  You 
can cc people in the GitHub system by adding in a @username, so if you 
want the review or feedback of specific people, you simply cc them in 
the PR message (as you saw Josh do above).</p>

<p>This is cool because the Pull Request feature let’s you comment on 
individual lines in the unified diff, on single commits or on the pull 
request itself and pulls everything inline to a single conversation 
view.
It also let you continue to push to the branch, so if someone comments 
that you forgot to do something or there is a bug in the code, you can 
fix it and push to the branch, GitHub will show the new commits in the 
conversation view and you can keep iterating on a branch like that.</p>

<p>If the branch has been open for too long and you feel it’s getting 
out of sync with the master branch, you can merge master into your topic
 branch and keep going.  You can easily see in the pull request 
discussion or commit list when the branch was last brought up to date 
with the ‘master’.</p>

<p><img src="GitHub%20Flow%20%E2%80%93%20Scott%20Chacon_files/2162f69e-d0a8-11e4-8c98-d2bb581f7152.png" alt="master merge"></p>

<p>When everything is really and truly done on the branch and you feel it’s ready to deploy, you can move on to the next step.</p>

<h4 id="5---merge-only-after-pull-request-review">#5 - merge only after pull request review</h4>

<p>We don’t simply do work directly on <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>
 or work on a topic branch and merge it in when we think it’s done - we 
try to get signoff from someone else in the company.  This is generally a
 +1 or emoji or “:shipit:” comment, but we try to get someone else to 
look at it.</p>

<p><img src="GitHub%20Flow%20%E2%80%93%20Scott%20Chacon_files/0ea37c4a-d0a8-11e4-8b61-7aa73b7e3b03.png" alt="shipit comment"></p>

<p>Once we get that, and the branch passes CI, we can merge it into 
master for deployment, which will automatically close the Pull Request 
when we push it.</p>

<h4 id="6---deploy-immediately-after-review">#6 - deploy immediately after review</h4>

<p>Finally, your work is done and merged into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>
 branch.  This means that even if you don’t deploy it now, people will 
base new work off of it and the next deploy, which will likely happen in
 a few hours, will push it out.  So since you really don’t want someone 
else to push something that you wrote that breaks things, people tend to
 make sure that it really is stable when it’s merged and people also 
tend to push their own changes.</p>

<p>Our campfire bot, hubot, can do deployments for any of the employees, so a simple:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>hubot depoy github to production
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>will deploy the code and zero-downtime restart all the necessary processes. You can see how common this is at GitHub:</p>

<p><img src="GitHub%20Flow%20%E2%80%93%20Scott%20Chacon_files/ebc7b3da-d0a7-11e4-96e3-cfe0cea6ae51.png" alt="our campfire logs"></p>

<p>You can see 6 different people (including a support guy and a designer) deploying about 24 times in one day.</p>

<p>I have done this for branches with one commit containing a one line 
change.  The process is simple, straightforward, scalable and powerful. 
You can do it with feature branches with 50 commits on them that took 2 
weeks, or 1 commit that took 10 minutes. It is such a simple and 
frictionless process that you are not annoyed that you have to do it 
even for 1 commit, which means people rarely try to skip or bypass the 
process unless the change is so small or insignificant that it just 
doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>This is an incredibly simple and powerful process.  I think most 
people would agree that GitHub has a very stable platform, that issues 
are addressed quickly if they ever come up at all, and that new features
 are introduced at a rapid pace.  There is no compromise of quality or 
stability so that we can get more speed or simplicity or less process.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Git itself is fairly complex to understand, making the workflow that 
you use with it more complex than necessary is simply adding more mental
 overhead to everybody’s day.  I would always advocate using the 
simplest possible system that will work for your team and doing so until
 it doesn’t work anymore and then adding complexity only as absolutely 
needed.</p>

<p>For teams that have to do formal releases on a longer term interval 
(a few weeks to a few months between releases), and be able to do 
hot-fixes and maintenance branches and other things that arise from 
shipping so infrequently, <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git-flow</a> makes sense and I would highly advocate it’s use.</p>

<p>For teams that have set up a culture of shipping, who push to 
production every day, who are constantly testing and deploying, I would 
advocate picking something simpler like GitHub Flow.</p>
