    </div>
    <p class="paragraph-3">If you&#x27;ve ever wondered where all your money goes, and want a simple way to track income and expenses, BudgeIt is your solution. BudgeIt is a budgeting app for visual learners; by presenting your monthly cash flow in easy to read charts and graphs, BudgeIt makes it easy to know exactly where your money is going each month.<br><br>BudgeIt can be used by anyone who earns and spends. The app will be especially beneficial for people who have bad spending habits.<br><br>BudgeIt gives users total customization in their budget. Users can create budget categories, and set a customizable time limit before each category resets. Each time a user makes a purchase, they enter it into BudgeIt and select which category it belongs to. Conversely, users can create savings categories, and set target goals for each category; users also select the amount of time these categories reset after . The goal of a budget category is to minimize money spent, whereas the goal of a savings category is to save at least a certain amount each month. Each time the user gets paid, they enter it into BudgeIt and select which category it belongs to. This allows the user to ensure that their income matches, or exceeds, their target budgeting goals.<br><br>Users with predictable income sources or expenses can set up recurring income and/or payments. For example, with this feature, instead of the user entering the amount they paid for a phone bill each month, they can set up a recurring payment, once, and BudgeIt will automatically add it every month. Optionally, BudgeIt will also remind the user to pay their bills.<br><br>Throughout the month, users will be able to see each of their categories slowly &quot;budge&quot; towards the limit with a playful, colourful, and visually pleasing user interface. All of the user&#x27;s categories are presented on the main page, so it is easy to track one&#x27;s budgets and savings. Savings categories are presented in a positive colour, like green, while budget categories are presented in a more urgent colour, like red. All the budget categories will be visually represented in various forms. This includes pie charts and bar graphs, for the user&#x27;s preferred period of time (as entered when creating a category). This will give the user a better sense of how they are spending their money. In addition to that, users will be able to compare their spending habits with nationwide statistics to give them an understanding of where they are on a nationwide scale in a financial context.<br><br>The primary goal of BudgeIt is to help people manage their money better. This will be measured by a decrease in irresponsible spending habits, an increased level of accuracy in predicting money spent in each category, and an increased amount of income put towards savings. These criteria will be measured by asking users, who have used the app for a significant amount of time, to fill out a questionnaire.</p>

        <p>I learnt that there are many unique challenges that arise from designing and creating large scale software compared to a small program I am making by myself. I learnt the importance of making a plan that is no more complicated then it needs to be. I learnt that everybody brings a unique skill set to the table and that it pays to utilize them. Finally, I learnt a broad range of tools for that are helpful, or necessary, for large scale software development. </p>

        <p>I learned the importance of making a solid plan when working with a team. Often when I do work on my own, I wing it without a plan and it usually works out. However when working with a team of people, you need to plan every step of the way, and communicate anything that goes wrong. This way everyone is aware of what to expect at the end of it.</p>

        <p>During the process of creating the &quot;BudgeIt&quot;, I developed very important skills: communication, teamwork, and writing better and more maintainable code. Working in the team taught me how to coordinate work among the team, explain my ideas and carefully listen to the ideas of each team member. Understanding and trust in each team member helped us to achieve a great result, and to build incredible android application &quot;BudgeIt&quot;. Also, I learned how to write better, more maintainable code, and evaluate the code of others to determine possible flaws. This knowledge includes planning, breaking the big features into smaller user stories, then into dev tasks, and proper testing. Furthermore, I gained the knowledge of version control, such as git, to be able to deliver updates constantly.</p>

        <p>I am Hiren Patel, throughout the development of this app, i have learnt several skills like analytical thinking, good decision making, patience, curiosity. Above all i have learnt that software development is all about self-teaching. In addition to that, i learnt that a software developer should always be willing to be a forever student because the “learning list” keeps getting bigger. I also studied the SOLID principles deeply and improved my testing skills.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-3"><strong>BudgeIt Architecture <br>‍</strong>BudgeIt is implemented using the 3-tier architecture pattern: UI layer, Logic layer, Database layer and domain specific objects. We have done lots of tests: unit tests, integration tests and acceptance tests.<br>‍<br>‍<strong>Domain Specific Objects<br>‍</strong>There are two main domain specific objects: Entry and Category.We have refactored the Entry DSO since we have implemented a new type of entry &quot;RecurringEntries&quot;.The Entry still stores data that makes up an entry: Amount, Details and Date which are all DSOs as well. The Entry has now been divided into 2 types: DefaultEntry and DefaultRecurringEntry. These two types of entries can be implemented either as Purchase or Income by extending their implementation to BaseIncome and BasePurchase.All these classes implement the BaseEntry interface directly or indirectly. The DefaultRecurringEntry consists of a RecurrencePeriod(a DSO as well) which enables an Entry to be recurring. The RecurrencePeriod consists of the frequency in years/months/weeks/days that an Entry should recur. The EntryList DSO helps return a list of all entries in different orders and its size.The Category class stores data that makes up a category: Amount, Details and DateModified which are all DSO&#x27;s as well. The Category has been divided into 2 types: DefaultSavingsCategory and DefaultBudgetCategory. All these classes implement the Category interface directly or indirectly. Each Category type has its own factory that takes care of different ways by which categories can be created. The CategoryList DSO helps return a list of all entries in different orders and its size.<br><br>‍<strong>The Logic Layer<br>‍</strong>We have added four new interfaces to the logic layer in iteration 3.The UIRecurringEntryManager creates new recurring entries, checks for recurring entries that will be due and schedule them to be posted. It also uses DateSource that gives detailed time up to milliseconds at the moment.The UICategoryColourizer and UIEntryColourizer gives the visual effects that helps indicate whether its on the good side(with respect to the budget set by the user) or the bad side. It gets the colour of the amount field and the colour of the monthly progress bar.The UIEntryBuilder builds a basic entry and adds any modifications to it, if needed e.g make it a recurring entry.<br><br>‍<strong>The UI Layer<br>‍</strong>We have added several new classes in the UI layer for Iteration 3.The UI layer works together with the logic layer and database to provide a good working graphical user interface.Each field on the user interface i.e: entry date, entry amount, entry description, category amount, category description has its own class that handles the data entered by the user and passes it to the logic layer and the database as well.<br><br>‍<strong>The Database Layer<br>‍</strong>In this iteration, we are still implementing a real database: SQLite.The Real database implements the database interface which covers all queries made from the UI layer or Logic layer or in the Database layer itself. The database has five main tables: DefaultEntries, RecurringEntries, DateLastChecked, Categories and IDs. Each table has its matching attributes with their implementation in logic layer or as DSOs. Some of the database queries include: insertEntry, deleteEntry, getRecurringEntries, getDateLastChecked, updateEntry, selectById, getIDCounter, updateIDCounter.The DatabaseFactory class enables us to either implement the database as a stub database or a real database(implemented using BudApplication class) or a test database. The DatabaseHolder makes sure the only one database object has been initialized and is being passed around the UI layer or Logic layer (The Singleton object).<br><br>‍<strong>Tests<br>‍</strong>Each UI element, logic layer element and database function has its own unit test. We have also implemented several integration tests to ensure there are no faults between integrated units. In addition to that we have implemented acceptance tests to meet the system&#x27;s compliance with the business requirements and deliver a good, working product.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-3">Over the course of the term, we learnt that in-person group meetings are, by far, the most effective way to plan out an iteration. However, the lack of a group meeting for iteration 3, due to the covid-19 crisis, did not cause a significant disruption. This is most likely due to our group being quite accustomed to working together at this point. This indicates that it is, perhaps, not necessary to have an in-person group meeting every iteration, although we would still prefer to have one in most situations. We found that it is important to be flexible with the allocation of our human resources. That is, not rigidly saying that Victor will work on the Database, Judah will work on the Logic Layer, and so on, but instead moving people around as necessary. This came in two parts. First, recognizing that one area of our project was beginning to fall behind the others. In our case the UI began to fall behind the other layers, not due to the people working on it not working hard enough, but instead because there simply were not enough people working on it. We found that a great indicator of this was the fact that there was functionality in the Logic Layer that was not being used by the UI. The second part was making the appropriate shift in personnel. In our case moving one of the two group members working on the Logic Layer into the UI.<br> <br>The biggest non-technical issue that we encountered was tasks being dependent on each other. The issue comes when a group member wants to start working on a task that was dependent on, not yet implemented, functionality elsewhere in the project. The worst-case scenario was that the group member would not be able to start working at all. The slightly better, and more common, scenario was that the group member would be able to work on the task, using a dummy implementation of the dependency, but would not be able to test or run the code that they had written. We first encountered this issue in iteration one. It was particularly salient then because our project had very little functionality at all. This caused a lot of waiting around for group members to implement the needed functionality. We identified this as an issue in our retrospective and settled on the solution of having personal deadlines for each task. This change, unfortunately, was not enacted in iteration two, and the issue persisted, though to a lesser degree. Once again, we brought it up in the retrospective and reiterated the importance of personal deadlines. <br><br>While strictly personal deadlines were not enacted for iteration three either, we organized all the tasks into three “clumps” each clump dependent on the last. We then worked on a clump for each week of the iteration. This worked well because, although dependencies still existed, they were contained within each clump, making the worst-case scenario be that a group member must do one, instead of three, weeks&#x27; worth of work in a day. Finally, towards the end of iteration three, we realized that Mockito could be used to alleviate many of these dependency issues.<br><br> We found that, when adopting a project-wide tool such as git, it was crucial that we all learn it as early as possible. If a group member puts off learning it, then, when it comes time for them to work on a real task, they must learn the tool on top of doing the task. Often, then, the tool is not learnt thoroughly and the problem cascades further.</p>
